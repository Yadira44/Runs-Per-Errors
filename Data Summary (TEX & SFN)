Looking at the data, the Rangers actually have a higher Runs / Errors percentage than the Giants (35.04%). 
The Rangers had an elite defensive team in 2023 so seeing that they let 37.1% of runs score after committing errors, this can be explained by multiple reasons. 
The most obvious reason is that since they were an elite defensive team that committed the least errors that year, the sample size makes the errors statistically heavier. 
This means that even with just a few “bad luck” errors, the percentage could go up just from that. 
The Giants’ larger amount of errors might be more evenly distributed, diluting the overall run impact of each one. 
Context matters and this can be another reason why the results are the way they are. 
Errors committed by the Rangers could have happened during a high-risk situation where there were players in scoring position which made it easier for runs to be scored. 
The pitcher could have also just been having a bad outage which resulted in those runs being scored, especially if they occurred during a third time through the order.
