### Overview

Runs_Per_Errors Average throughout 2019-2024: 31.70%
This means runs are scored in the same inning as errors 31.70% of the time. 
Across 6 seasons, I found that there is an average of 31.7% of runs being scored in the same inning as errors occur. This means that 1 out of 3 runs come in the same inning as an error. This suggests that errors do play a role in runs being scored across all of Major League Baseball. There is no guarantee that runs are going to score immediately after an error, but it does make it more likely. This doesn’t mean that errors directly cause runs–it just shows a connection. There are still other factors that play into the inning like lineup strength, pitcher meltdown, etc. The 31.7% is not major but it does show that two independent stats (runs and errors) is significant. We can look deeper into this more by looking at what inning
